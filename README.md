🚀 Travel Time Prediction Using Random Forest
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting travel times based on historical data using machine learning techniques. The dataset (travel_times.csv) is processed and analyzed to train a Random Forest model, which helps in making accurate travel time predictions.

🛠 Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language
Pandas & NumPy: Data processing and manipulation
Seaborn & Matplotlib: Data visualization
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model training and evaluation
🔍 Features
✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
✅ Feature Selection & Engineering
✅ Machine Learning Model Training using Random Forest
✅ Model Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Mean Absolute Error

📊 Model Performance
The Random Forest model was trained and evaluated using multiple metrics. The performance was measured using:
✔ Accuracy - Measures overall correctness
✔ Precision - How many predicted positives were actually correct
✔ Recall - How many actual positives were correctly identified
✔ F1-score - Harmonic mean of precision and recall
✔ Mean Absolute Error (MAE) - Measures error in continuous predictions

📌 Future Improvements
🔹 Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy
🔹 Experiment with other models like XGBoost, Decision Trees, or Neural Networks
🔹 Deploy the model as an API for real-time predictions
