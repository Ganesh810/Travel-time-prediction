Travel Time Prediction Using Random Forest
Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict travel times using a dataset (travel_times.csv). The model is built using the Random Forest algorithm, leveraging various performance metrics for evaluation.

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas & NumPy for data processing
Seaborn & Matplotlib for data visualization
Scikit-learn for machine learning (RandomForestRegressor & RandomForestClassifier)
Features
Data preprocessing and analysis
Model training and evaluation
Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and mean absolute error
How to Run
Install required dependencies:
nginx
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
Load the dataset: travel_times.csv
Execute the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance.
